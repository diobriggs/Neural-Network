#Neural Network for Binary Classification
#Overview
This Python code implements a simple neural network for binary classification using backpropagation. The network is trained on two datasets (dataset1_training.txt and dataset2_training.txt) and tested on corresponding testing datasets. Visualization of decision boundaries is provided using matplotlib.

#Contents
neural_network.py: Contains the main code implementing the neural network.
dataset1_training.txt: Training data for dataset 1.
dataset1_testing.txt: Testing data for dataset 1.
dataset2_training.txt: Training data for dataset 2.
dataset2_testing.txt: Testing data for dataset 2.
#How to Use
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib
Run the neural_network.py script:

bash
Copy code
python neural_network.py
View the console output for training progress, and accuracy on the testing datasets.

Decision boundaries will be visualized using matplotlib.

#Parameters
